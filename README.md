Project:
Analysis of Call Volume and Performance Across Multiple Carriers and Gateways

Overview:
This project analyzes call volume and performance metrics across multiple carriers and gateways to uncover insights that can help improve call center operations, enhance customer experience, and gain a competitive edge in the industry. The analysis was performed using Power BI for data visualization.

Goals:

1. Identify the usage patterns and performance of different carriers.
2. Determine the correlation between total call volumes and successful call completions.
3. Analyze call volume distribution across different days of the week.
4. Provide actionable recommendations based on the findings.
   
Process:
A. Data Collection
1. Data Sources: Call logs, carrier performance reports, and gateway metrics.
2. Data Extraction: Extracted raw data from various databases and systems.
3. Data Integration: Unified data from different sources into a consistent dataset.

B. Data Cleaning
1. Data Validation: Checked for missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
2. Handling Missing Data: Imputation, interpolation, or exclusion as needed.
3. Data Normalization: Standardized data formats, units, and scales.
4. Outlier Detection and Treatment: Identified and corrected data anomalies.
5. Data Transformation: Aggregated daily call volumes, calculated success rates, and derived additional metrics.

C. Data Analysis
1. Descriptive Analysis: Summarized central tendencies, dispersion, and distribution of call volumes and success rates.
2. Carrier Usage and Call Volumes: Calculated total call volumes, ranked carriers, and determined percentage contributions.
3. Correlation Analysis: Assessed the relationship between total calls and success calls.
4. Success Call Ranges: Analyzed the range of success calls across carriers.
5. Daily Call Volumes: Aggregated call volumes by day of the week and identified trends.
   
D. Data Visualization with Power BI
1. Dashboard Creation: Interactive dashboards to visualize key metrics and trends.
2. Filters and Drill-Downs: Enabled exploration of data at various levels of detail.
3. Dynamic Reports: Reports that update automatically with new data.

E. Interpretation and Reporting
1. Insights Summary: Interpreted analysis results and highlighted key findings.
2. Recommendations: Actionable recommendations for enhancing call center operations and optimizing resource allocation.

Key Findings:
1. Carrier-2_b_in Dominance: Handled over 4.1 million total calls, more than 5,000% higher than Carrier-3_in.
2. Call Volume Distribution: Carrier-2_b_in accounted for 47% of the total calls across all carriers.
3. Positive Correlation: Higher call volumes were associated with higher success rates.
4. Success Call Variability: Significant variability in success rates between carriers, ranging from 33,629 to 1,627,514 total success calls.
5. Daily Call Volume Trends: Monday had the highest total calls, followed by Saturday, Sunday, and Tuesday.

Recommendations:
1. Optimize Carrier Usage: Focus on high-performing carriers to ensure maximum call success rates.
2. Adjust Staffing: Increase staffing levels on high-call-volume days (e.g., Mondays) to handle peak times efficiently.
3. Monitor and Improve: Regularly monitor carrier performance and implement improvements based on data trends.
